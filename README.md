# Q-Learning
Different Q-learning algorithms build with Keras with a Tensorflow back end, tested in OpenAI Gym environments.

Current algorithms:

| Algorithm                                       |CartPole   |Atari   |
|-------------------------------------------------|:---------:|:-------|
|	Deep Q-Network                                  |Yes        |Yes     |
|	Double Deep Q-Network                           |Yes        |Yes     |
|	Deep Q-Network with dueling architecture        |Yes        |No      |
|	Double Deep Q-Network with dueling architecture |Yes        |No      |

Beamrider-v4 was used as Atari environment, but with some small changes this can be used in other atari environments as well.
